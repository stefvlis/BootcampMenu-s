# BootcampMenu's

## What is it?
In this project we simulate an online food ordering system, in which you can choose from a selection of dishes on a menu. Once the order is complete, the program shows the total amount that has to be paid.
We write this program in 3 different languages, namely Powershell, Javascript and C#.

## Installation
In order to run the Javascipt version of the program, you need to make sure that [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed.
You also need to run the following command in your terminal to install a required package:
```
npm install prompt-sync
```
## Execution
